# Dotfiles

Here's all my configuration for fish, distrobox, starship and more!
If you want to build your own dotfiles repo, just fork it and feel free to make the `home/` and `packages/` folders yours.
It's really simple yet powerful.

## Installation

This will create all symlinks needed

```bash
  ./install.sh
```

## Add a file to the repo

```bash
  ./add_config.sh <path/to/config>
```

## How to manage your own fork

The only files you really need are `install.sh` and `add_config.sh`, the rest are just personal configs and utilities
